[OpenAPI Generator](https://gitlab.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) is a code generator that supports generation of
API client libraries, server stubs and documentation automatically
given an [OpenAPI Spec](https://gitlab.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

The Ada client and server support has been integrated in [OpenAPI Generator](https://gitlab.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

The OpenAPI Ada library is a small support library for the Ada code generator
provided by OpenAPI Generator.  The library provides support to serialize the data,
make HTTP requests and support the [OpenAPI Spec](https://gitlab.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
specific operations or types.

## Version 0.9.0   - Under development
  - Update the openapi generator to version 7.11.0
    - Fixed incorrect type declarations
    - Added support for default values
    - Fixed incorrect extraction of request body parameters for JSON and XML
    - Added `x-ada-type-name` that can be put on the request body
      to override a default request parameter name
    - Fixed default request body parameter name to remove the
      `_Type` that is added
    - Updated GNAT project generation
  - Allow to build and install without Alire
  - Fix #21: Response 201..2xx are not considered successful

## Version 0.8.0   - Sep 2024
  - Cleanup build environment to drop configure
  - Integrate swagger-ui-5.17.14
  - Update the openapi generator to version 7.9.0

[List all versions](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/openapi-ada/blob/master/NEWS.md)

## Using with Alire

If you are using [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) in your project, run the following command
within your [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) project to use the library:

### OpenAPI Client

```
alr with openapi
```

For the HTTP connection, you can either use AWS or Curl and run one of the following commands:

```
alr with utilada_curl
alr with utilada_aws
```

### OpenAPI Server

```
alr with openapi_server
```

For the server part, you must choose a servlet web container that will handle the requests.
Two web server implementations are provided:

* [AWS](https://github.com/AdaCore/aws)
* [EWS](https://github.com/simonjwright/ews)

and you should run one of the following `alr` command depending on your choice:

```
alr with servletada_aws
alr with servletada_ews
```

## Using without Alire

If you don't have [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) or want to build and install the library
on a specific place, run a `setup` command to configure the build as well as installation
directory.

The OpenAPI Ada library provides support for client and server.  The client part has
less constraints than the server part which needs more components.

The `HAVE_ALIRE` configuration allows you to disable the build with [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/),
the `HAVE_SERVER` controls whether you want to build and get the support for the server part,
the `HAVE_AWS` controls the support for AWS, `HAVE_CURL` the support for Curl in the client part
and `HAVE_EWS` controls the support for EWS as server.

```
make setup BUILD=debug PREFIX=/build/install HAVE_ALIRE=no HAVE_EWS=no HAVE_AWS=yes \
    HAVE_SERVER=yes HAVE_CURL=no
```

Since this build method does not verify that all dependencies are met, make sure that you
have already built and install the following components and they are available to `gprbuild`
through `ADA_PROJECT_PATH` if needed:

* [Ada Utility Library](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-util/)

The server part needs the following components:

* [Ada Servlet](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-servlet/)
* [Ada Security Library](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-security/)
* [Ada EL Library](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-el/)

Then build, run the unit tests and install by using:

```
make
make test
make install
```

To use the installed libraries, make sure your `ADA_PROJECT_PATH` contains the directory
where you installed the libraries (configured by the `PREFIX=<path>` option in the setup phase).
The installed GNAT projects are the same as those used when using [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/).

The git repository comes with a pre-compiled [OpenAPI Generator](https://gitlab.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
that will be installed in `/usr/local/share/openapi-ada/openapi-generator-cli.jar`.  To help in launching the
generator, a script is installed in `/usr/local/bin/openapi-generator`.  You must have a Java JRE installed
to be able to run the generator.

## Docker

A docker container is available for those who want to try OpenAPI Ada without installing
and building all required packages.  To use the OpenAPI Ada docker container you can
run the following commands:

```
sudo docker pull ciceron/openapi-ada
```

## Using OpenAPI Ada


### Generating the REST client from OpenAPI Spec

The command to generate an Ada REST client is the following:
```
  alr exec -- openapi-generate-client -i my-api.yaml \
       --additional-properties projectName=MyProject \
       --additional-properties openApiName=OpenAPI \
       --additional-properties httpSupport=Curl \
       --model-package MyProject.MyModule -o .
```

where *my-api.yaml* is the OpenAPI specification file that describes your API,
*MyProject* is the name of the GNAT project to use,
*MyProject.MyModule* is the name of the Ada package that will be the parent
package of the generated Ada packages.

The generator will create several files in *client/src/client* with basically
two packages: *MyProject.MyModule*.Models and *MyProject.MyModule*.Clients.
The **Models** child package will contain the type definitions for the
API operations describes in the YAML file and the **Clients** child package
will contain the *Client_Type* tagged record with the API operations to
invoke the REST API.

For example, if the YAML description file contains the following API
operation:
```
openapi: 3.0.0

  - url: 'https://todo.vacs.fr/v1'
  - url: 'http://todo.vacs.fr/v1'

      required:
        - id
        - title
        - status
        - create_date
      example:
        id: 23
        title: Make the FOSDEM presentation
        description: password
        status: working
        create_date: '2017-12-24T00:00:00.000Z'
      xml:
        name: Todo
```

The generator will generate the following Ada code in the *Models* child package:
```
package Todos.Models is
   ...
   type Todo_Type is
     record
       Id : OpenAPI.Long;
       Title : OpenAPI.UString;
       Create_Date : OpenAPI.Datetime;
       Done_Date : OpenAPI.Nullable_Date;
       Status : OpenAPI.UString;
     end record;
     ...
end Todos.Models;
```

and the following code in the *Clients* child package:

```
package Todos.Clients is
   ...
   type Client_Type is new OpenAPI.Clients.Client_Type with null record;
   --  List the available tasks
   --  The list of tasks can be filtered by their status.
   procedure List_Todos
      (Client : in out Client_Type;
       Status : in OpenAPI.Nullable_UString;
       Result : out Todos.Models.Todo_Type_Vectors.Vector);

   --  Redirect to the UI
   --  Default operation to redirect to the UI index page.
   procedure Redirect_Todos
      (Client : in out Client_Type);
   ...
end Todos.Clients;
```

### Initialization

The HTTP/REST support is provided by [Ada Util](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-util)
and encapsulated by [OpenAPI Ada](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/openapi-ada).  This support
is either based on Curl or on [AWS](https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/).
The OpenAPI code generator uses Curl by default and this can be changed when running
the `openapi-generator` tool and changing the following option:

```
       --additional-properties httpSupport=aws
```


If you want to use Curl, the initialization should use the following:

```
   Util.Http.Clients.Curl.Register;
```

But if you want to use [AWS](https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/), you will initialize with:

```
   Util.Http.Clients.AWS.Register;
```

Curl may be easier to start with because [AWS](https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)
does not support HTTP DELETE operation except in some latest version.

After the initialization is done, you will declare a client instance to access
the API operations:

```
   C : Todos.Clients.Client_Type;
```

The 'Client_Type' is the generated type that will implement the operations
described in the OpenAPI description file.

And you should initialize the server base URI you want to connect to:

```
  C.Set_Server ("http://localhost:8080/v1");
```

At this stage, you can use the generated operation.

### Calling an operation

Let's retrieve some todo list by calling the 'List_Todo' operation.
This operation needs an integer as input parameter and returns a 'Pet_Type'
object that contains all the pet information.   You will first declare
the pet instance as follows:

```
  List     : Todos.Models.Todo_Type_Vectors.Vector;
```

And then call the 'Get_Pet_By_Id' operation:

```
  C.List_Todos ((Is_Null => True, Value => <>), List);
```

At this stage, you can access the list of todos:

```
procedure Print (Todo : in Todos.Models.Todo_Type) is
begin
   Put (OpenAPI.Long'Image (Todo.Id));
   Set_Col (6);
   Put (OpenAPI.To_String (Todo.Status));
   Set_Col (15);
   Put (Ada.Calendar.Formatting.Image (Todo.Create_Date));
   Set_Col (40);
   if Todo.Done_Date.Is_Null then
      Put ("-");
   else
      Put (Ada.Calendar.Formatting.Image (Todo.Done_Date.Value));
   end if;
   Set_Col (60);
   Put (OpenAPI.To_String (Todo.Title));
   New_Line;
end Print;

  for T of List loop
     Print (T);
  end loop;
```
